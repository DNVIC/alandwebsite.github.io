      <p>Our country is made up of thousands of islands, skerries, and hundreds of lakes. There are many fjords in Åland, and various forests dot the islands.</p>
      <p>Åland has very few natural resources, besides clay, wood and granite, which can be found throughout the islands.</p>
      <p>Our population estimate is 28,500 people, of which about 11000 live in the capital, 90% live on the main island, and the rest live on all the other islands.</p>
      <p>The main industries are Shipping, Tourism, and Trade, which most people work in.</p>
      <p>The population of our country are unilingually Swedish and ethnically Swedish</p>
      <p>There are ferries between islands, and roads between most islands, as well as roads across the main island.</p>
