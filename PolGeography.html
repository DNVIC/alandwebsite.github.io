    <h1 class=heading1>Location</h1>
    <p>Our country is surrounded by the Baltic Sea, with a maritime border with Finland to our East, and a tiny land border on an island with Sweden to the West. <br></p>
    
    <p>We are in the NE quadrant, in Europe. <br>Our capital is located at 60°06′N 019°56′E</p>

    <h1 class=heading1>Features & Environment</h1>
        <p>The highest peak in Åland is Orrdalsklint <br>
        We are part of the barrier between the Gulf of Bothnia and the rest of the Baltic Sea. <br>
        We also have 300 lakes, the largest of which being Långsjön. <br>
        We have over 6000 islands and skerries, the largest being Fasta Åland <br>
        To the West, there is the Åland sea, part of the Gulf of Bothnia 
        </p>
        <h2 class=heading2> Vegetation & Climate</h2>
        <p> The vegetation in the country is richer than the surrounding countries, due to the fertility of our soils, because our soil used to be covered by glaciers, most of which formed the Baltic Sea. <br>
        The climate of our country is cold, due to the latitude being so high up. </p>
