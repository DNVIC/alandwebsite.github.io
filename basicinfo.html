      <h1 class="heading3 centertext"> History  </h1>
      <p> For most of our history, we've been part of Sweden, or some other Swedish state before the modern state of Sweden. However, in 1809 we became part of the Grand Duchy of FInland, which was also part of Russia. 
        In 1917, Finland became independent and we joined Finland involuntarily. There was an international dispute over whether we would join Sweden or Finland, but after World War II our population generally felt a "Shared Destiny" with Finland.
        In 2020, however, our population gradually shifted towards not wanting to be part of Finland anymore. In 2025, a referendum was held stating whether Åland should stay part of Finland or not. A majority of the population of the islands said Åland
        should not be a part of Finland anymore. However, a second referendum was held, which gave the choices of either independence or joining Sweden. We chose independence, as we enjoyed the autonomy that we had under Finnish rule and we didn't want to lose it
        under Sweden.  </p>
      <h1 class="heading3"> Our Flag </h1>
      <img class=flag src=flag.svg> </img>
      <p> Our flag has three different colors, red, blue, and gold. <br><br> The yellow and gold stand for our Swedish ties, being the same colors as the flag of Sweden. <br>
      The red stands for our Finnish ties, being the same color as their coat of arms. </p>
      <h1 class="heading3 righttext"> Our Anthem </h1>
      <p class=righttext> Our anthem is "Ålänningens sång", translated to "Song of the Ålander" </p>

      <b>
        Verse 1
      </b> <br>
      The land of thousand islands and skerries, <br>
      Born from deep beneath the waves <br>
      Åland, our Åland, our home it is <br>
      Thee we long to meet <br> <br>
      Ancient graves beneath the birches <br>
      Tells of our thousand year history <br>
      We will never forget the land of our Fathers <br>
      No matter where we will go <br>
      No matter where we will go <br>
      <br>
      <b>
          Verse 2
        </b> <br>
        Lovely is our Åland when bays and straits <br>
        Become blue in the bright days of spring <br>
        It's delightful to wander in forest and grove <br>
In the flowered fields of our shores. <br> <br>
Midsummer pole to evening red sky <br>
Is raised by willing hands <br>
Farthest out in the skerry fisher village <br>
Beacons are lit by the young <br>
Beacons are lit by the young <br> <br> <b>
Verse 3</b> <br>
Lovely is our Åland when the froth of waves <br>
is whirling against the mighty precipice <br>
When the church folks steer beneath the stars <br>
Over the icy depths of the sea <br> <br>
Even when storm roars, in the cottages' peace <br>
The song of the spinning wheel is sung <br>
The memory of loving childhood is <br>
Happily praised by the sons <br>
Happily praised by the sons <br> <br>
<b>Verse 4 </b> <br>
Never have Ålandian women and men <br>
Let the honour of their tribe down <br>
Warfare threatened us, but victoriously yet <br>
We carry the heritage of freedom <br> <br>
Loudly shall it sound, our Swedish language <br>
Spoken with an urging voice <br>
Enlighten our path like a sea mark of flames <br>
Show us where we belong <br>
Show us where we belong <br>
